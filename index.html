									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p style="text-align:justify">As someone who was born in the era when technology is ubiquitous, my daily life and learning process heavily rely on technological devices and services as they are capable of providing many different resources. However, my interest in IT didn‚Äôt spark until I attended the ICT class in high school and had a brief taste of coding through some HTML and Turtle Graphics short extra lessons that my teacher decided to show just for fun. Though the furthest that we got in class was creating a static webpage, I had a lot of fun playing around with it during my free time trying to add anchor link and I did some self-study about CSS. Watching tech-related videos from channels like ‚ÄúLinus Tech Tips‚Äù, ‚ÄúAustin Evans‚Äù, ‚ÄúDave Lee‚Äù, etc. on YouTube is also one of the reasons for my interest in IT. The channel ‚ÄúCS Dojo‚Äù is also a huge inspiration for me to choose IT as my major in university and it also give me a better view of IT as a job through interviews with experienced employees from various tech companies.</br> 
    After graduation, I began to research more on the IT field and found out that being a ‚Äúapplication developer‚Äù really suits my personal preference. It is one of the very few careers that reconciles both of my interests in art and mathematics. While the logical thinking I learnt from solving math problems can be implied in the process of coding, my artistic side allows me to nourish the project that I work on.</br> 
   The main reason why I chose to come to RMIT is because of the great facility that the school has to offer and its international environment where I can meet friends that share the same interest with me from all around the world. I‚Äôm also aiming for the transfer program to Melbourne, Australia since it is a great opportunity to study abroad and gain experiences from a developed country. It also gives me a chance to get an internship in a country that is known for its constantly developing IT community. </br>
   I hope that during the time studying at RMIT, I can acquire the ability to communicate effectively with my teammates as it is an indispensable soft skill that will support me a lot in the future. Besides that, being able to code without or little errors is also something that I want to learn during my studies. However, I think the most important thing is the experience to work together as a group during projects as all IT-related jobs require a high level of teamwork to accomplish a project.

									<h3>Ideal job</h3>
									<p style="text-align:justify">Google has always been the workplace that every IT student dream of, including me. The company is well known for its ideal working environment where the employees can enjoy themselves instead of stressing out. Its high flexibility work style allowing the employees to work anytime, anywhere is also something that I really adore.</br>
  The position that I‚Äôm aiming for is ‚ÄúiOS Software Engineer‚Äù ‚Äì a job which is currently in high demand because of Google‚Äôs expanding services and constant changes in Apple‚Äôs operating system.

												<h4>Job description</h4>
												<p style="text-align:justify">Develop Google‚Äôs applications e.g. YouTube, Chrome, Google Drive, Maps, etc. that are specialized to work on iOS platform. Design and improve UI/UX. Work on utilizing all capabilities of the newest device. Increase the security for users.</br>
   As an iPhone user, I‚Äôve got used to a lot of different applications on this platform, including Google‚Äôs applications and services. With that said, from a user standpoint, I was able to see rooms for improving these applications and know the general users‚Äô expectation on the upcoming products. Apple's constant upgrade on hardware also makes the iOS application developing industry more diverse and interesting as there would be more technologies for developers to consider and utilize all the potential of the device (for example: FaceID can be used as a method of identification in many apps involving transactions, universal NFC already available in iPhone makes money transactions a lot easier, etc.). Another reason why I chose this career is that nowadays, Apple‚Äôs iPhone is dominating the smartphone market resulting in the high demand for ‚ÄúiOS developer‚Äù so learning it would increase the chance to get an internship and have the work experience which can assist me during my job applying to Google. </p>
											</div>

											<div >
												<h4>Job requirement and my future plan</h4>
												<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, my skill regarding coding is very limited and I only have a few experiences with Python. In order to develop iOS platform applications, knowledge about Swift and Objective C is essential so I‚Äôm planning to self-study both languages along with Python and C++ from the programs at RMIT. Along side with studying these programming languages, I will spend my free time getting used to iOS SDK which Apple offer to Mac users for free just like Xcode. During the time studying at RMIT, I will also have Mobile Application Development as one of my program electives. Apple's WWDC videos <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2019/">playlist</a> is a great resource to gain more knowledge about developing an iOS app from so I also spend my time watching those videos for out-of-class study .</br>
As mentioned before, communication skills is crucial in IT industry as it requires a huge amount of teamwork so I hope that I can improve my soft skills my joining RED volunteer at RMIT and through group projects. Experience is another indispensable factor in order to apply for big companies like Google so if I‚Äôm qualified for the transfer program, I‚Äôll search for an internship in Australia to get used to work-place and learn from those who has experience in the industry. During my third year, I will also utilize the Flagship internship course that the school offer as well as getting advice from seniors to have an internship in a good company.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Personality test result</h4>
												<p style="text-align:justify">From the result of the personality test, it shows that I have a rather diplomatic mind. However, my introvert percentage is very high which results in my lack of communication skill. With that said, one of the most important aspect that I need to work on during this group project is opening up with my peers and have conversations with them as much as possible and having an extrovert member or someone that I‚Äôm comfortable speaking with in the group would help me a lot within the process.</br>
 Being turbulent is also one of the problems I have to deal with in real life as this can greatly reduce my self-confident sometimes. However, it can be a motivation for me as well; a great example is that whenever I work on something, I usually take other people‚Äôs opinions to consideration and try my best to improve the product. This also makes me suitable to become a ‚Äúcreator‚Äù or more specifically ‚Äúapplication engineer‚Äù since the feedback from users is what determine the success of an app.</br>
 As for the ability of future planning, my Judging is dominant and it has been proved to be true a few times. I usually come up with the plan far ahead of the deadline just to give me more time for any adjustments just in case anything goes wrong. With this characteristic of mine, I prefer working with those who have high responsibility and I most likely to take the role of project planner for the group. </p>

												<h4>Learning style test result</h4>
													<p style="text-align:justify">
												Learning style is visual: Visual learning means that I can learn by looking at demonstrations, notes, charts, graphics, etc. rather than just listening. From this result, I can find ways to improve my learning strategy for example, taking notes and read them afterwards can help me absorb the knowledge more effectively. Being a visual learner also help me to point out mistakes slightly more easily so I hope this can be applied to improve upcoming project, especially product testing stage.</p>

												<h4>Creativity test result</h4>
												<p style="text-align:justify">In the IT industry, more specifically ‚Äúsoftware engineer‚Äù, creativity is a requisite factor so this result can have a huge impact on my career choice. Overall, my creativity level is slightly higher than average, especially my curiosity level. This means that I usually have the desire to change and test out things that people take for granted. It can be a huge perk for me as a developer because all of the life-changing inventions are created by those who managed to break the boundaries and improve on the aspects that no one really care about. Besides that, my ‚Äúperspective‚Äù point is also higher than typical showing that I am able to take both sides of an argument. With that said, I hope I can take the role of reconciling any conflicts that might occur during the time working on the project with other members. However, I‚Äôm still lack of boldness so I hope that I can have other members‚Äô support and encouragement within the process.</p>

									<h3>Project idea</h3>
						
							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<ul><li>My project idea is developing a 2D, 8-bit role-play game.</li>
  											<li><p style="text-align:justify">This game will involve puzzle solving skill and decision making. Each choice that the player make will affect the ending of the game. There will be many different pieces of information that can be found within the game which will unveil different aspects of the story and the player can base on that and make their decision accordingly. It is made for those who enjoy doing brain teaser and solving mystery. It also allows the player to use their imagination to have different interpretations about the story from each piece of information that they have.</p></li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Motivation</h4>
							<p style="text-align:justify">Though my ideal job is iOS software engineer, developing games is also an area that I‚Äôve always wanted to try at least once. I personally think that it is important for the members to enjoy the process of developing the project and also have fun during the product testing which make ‚Äúgame developing‚Äù a great choice for this project and a good opportunity for me to try out what I have always wanted to do. Another important reason is that the tools and applications needed to create a game is much more obtainable than those needed to create an iOS app. Moreover, I think that trying out different areas and acquire different skills other than my those that needed for my ideal job would support me a lot in my future as well as give me more flexibility on my career pathway.</p>
							<h4>Description</h4>
							<p style="text-align:justify">
					 		 This game is in 8-bit role play game.</br>
							The main inputs are 4 arrow buttons to move the character in the game, ‚ÄúD‚Äù button for the interactions between the character and various objects in the game, ‚ÄúW‚Äù button to open directory and equip items, ‚ÄúA‚Äù button to bring up other functionalities (settings, save game, load game).  </br>
						
							General concept:
								<ul>
							<li>In this game, you‚Äôll be a little boy whose father was captured to an abandoned ‚Äútown‚Äù full of disfigured creatures referred to as ‚Äúprodigium‚Äù by our main character (MC). To rescue his father, the MC need to go through 7 dungeons (1 of them is mainly for tutorial) and at the end of each dungeon will be a mini boss.</li>
							<li>Along the way to the boss fight, there would be a lot of traps set by ‚Äúprodigium‚Äù which our MC will need the use of his wit to overcome these obstacles. Traps set in the game are puzzles and there are might be some items set in the game that need to be obtained and used wisely to complete the puzzle.</li>
							<li>On the way to each dungeon, the MC will encounter NPCs who will give him some useful information.</li>
							<li>In each dungeon, the player will be able to find small pieces of information about the history of the town of ‚Äúprodigium‚Äù was formed and it might change the player‚Äôs point of view about the whole story.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
							<p style="text-align:justify"><ul>
								<li>Computer with Unity equipped, there‚Äôs a free version for this app</li>
								<li>Garage band for theme music/ sound effect ‚Äì this app is free on Apple devices</li>
								<li>Adobe Premiere for designing introduction/menu/settings screen (UI)</li>
											</ul>

</p>
							<h4>Skills required</h4>
							<p style="text-align:justify"><ul>
					<li>Character/ sprite, background design - since this is in pixelated art style, it is quite easy to work on the design.</li> 
					<li>Designing menu/ settings/ inventory screen (UI) - Similar to character designing, this mostly involves photo editing, button layout and Unity offers a really user-friendly interface for this task as it doesn‚Äôt involve coding.</li>
					<li>Music/ instrumental arrangement ‚Äì Thanks to the Garage Band app that included in iPhone, anyone can create a simple background music for the game. For missing sound effect, we can find it easily from a large variety of resources for free on the internet.</li>
					<li>Coding for the movement ‚Äì This game doesn‚Äôt require complex movements thus this can be done fairly easily, there are also basic scripts from Google so if we run out of time, we can just use the free online script and re-map the buttons layout. </li>
					<li>Writing the script for menu/ settings/ inventory screen (UI) ‚Äì Just like for the movements, coding is needed for the buttons on the UI to actually work. Again, there are many example scripts for basic buttons (play, load, save, etc.) available so most of the work is already done and all we have to do is a bit modification so that it would work for our game. The most complicated that it can get for this part is for equipping items but it really depends on the amount of item available which, in this case, there won‚Äôt be much.</li> 
					<li>Creating stages/ game screen in the game by putting the elements together, adding animations, layers, effects, etc. - This is the most complicated job in developing the game since Unity, unlike Game Maker, requires a lot of coding. Luckily, this game doesn‚Äôt involve much interactions so this can be done by the help of tutorial videos from the YouTube and members of the group don‚Äôt necessarily be professionals in Unity, as long as they‚Äôre hard working and responsible. The channel that I‚Äôm currently studying Unity from is Brackeys and there‚Äôs a whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6">playlist</a> dedicated to Unity from this channel that I found very useful. In order for this part to be successfully done, there must be a lot of patience for testing and debug many different stages even if the interactions in this game is quite limited. Even for groups of professionals, it‚Äôs hard to get the game to run smoothly from the first try so a lot of trials-and-errors during the development is to be expected, especially at this stage. </li>
											</ul>
</p>
							<h4>Outcome</h4>
							<p style="text-align:justify">If this project is successful, the outcome would be an interesting little game for the class to test out and simply have fun figuring out the answer for given puzzles together. This would be the first time for me to actually develop a project so if I manage to make this project come to life, I really want to receive the feedback from the users regarding the overall experience in order for me to improve my future projects. From this project, not only that I can acquire new knowledge in game-making but also gain new experience as a developer which can help me one step closer to my ideal job.</p>
